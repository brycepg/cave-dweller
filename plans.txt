-- Todo --
|Use mouse for movement
|mouse actions
|Add system for mutli-turn movements(Like diagnal movement)
|fix player block movement accross blocks(two move jump?)

|entity system
|better AI for monster movement(hand in hand with enitity component system)
|Centipides - Fish/rivers - Salamanders - Bats - Tree-like objects


|Clickable menu
    - System for menus

|biomes - world generation algo tweaking - dynamic generation of build dig tiles?
|Advanced generation menu(tweak generator/ set seed)


| display log of messages 
| in-game log of accomplishments

| food - hunger/satiety - inventory - harvest - inventory menu
| babies(breeding)

help menu

| clusters of ore
| different types of rock

ecosystem management
towns/buildings/door/crafting
wait screen

-- consideration --
mutable tiles?

-- shelved --
map viewer/tuner program
"Update" a block from when it was previously loaded(take the difference of the block's saved turn and current turn, and run its process loop that number of times)
    - too slow / buggy (partial updates?)
    - 'general update' of block instead of object movement?

-- Done --
inactive, in memory blocks
priority for showing entities. tiles -> ground entityies(plants) -> monster -> player (last movement right now)
array for walkable tiles
array for hidden tiles
spaw x, y for map generation
| change all access to tiles array
use array for storing objects
debug menu
Using mouse for inspection
Hysteresis for loading/unload block to stop unsteady state
Don't update turns during setup process(separate turn update from process)
fix automatic movement from new game
allow objects to move out of map - temporarily load blocks to allow this(stagger cull blocks)
staggered update of nearby blocks(load, process, no draw) - may need to tweak still
add basic monster object
move off of root console(space of ui)
adding turns -> turn counter for moves at bottom of screen

# using mouse/keyboard for inspection

-- Detailed Plans --
Determine position of mouse on screen
| if withing game position
| based on center loc, find mouse
| center (abs coordinates)
| center_x mouse_console_x
Show object if any
if no object show tile
For objects, show "You see a(n) (Class name)"
If not hidden(?! just for tiles now)
For tiles, show "You see a(n) (Tile name)"
If no object and no tiles, 
show nothing
in the future, show items(between objects and tiles)
