-- Todo -- 
Using mouse/keyboard for inspection
Add system for mutli-turn movements(Like diagnal movement)
fix player(object?) block movement accross blocks(two move jump?)
Use mouse for movement
- use array for storing objects OR BSP?
    - better AI for monster movement(hand in hand with enitity component system, storing objects in array?)
    - priority for showing entities. tiles -> ground entityies(plants) -> monster -> player
display log of messages to right
debug menu
in-game log of accomplishments
food - hunger/satiety - inventory - harvest - inventory menu
help menu
clusters of ore
different types of rock
babies(breeding)
ecosystem management
towns/buildings/door/crafting
Centipides - Fish/rivers - Salamanders - Bats
"Update" a block from when it was previously loaded(take the difference of the block's saved turn and current turn, and run its process loop that number of times)

mutable tiles?

-- shelved --
map viewer/tuner program

-- Done --
Hysteresis for loading/unload block to stop unsteady state
Don't update turns during setup process(separate turn update from process)
fix automatic movement from new game
allow objects to move out of map - temporarily load blocks to allow this(stagger cull blocks)
staggered update of nearby blocks(load, process, no draw) - may need to tweak still
add basic monster object
move off of root console(space of ui)
adding turns -> turn counter for moves at bottom of screen

# using mouse/keyboard for inspection

-- Detailed Plans --
Determine position of mouse on screen
| if withing game position
| based on center loc, find mouse
| center (abs coordinates)
| center_x mouse_console_x
Show object if any
if no object show tile
For objects, show "You see a(n) (Class name)"
If not hidden(?! just for tiles now)
For tiles, show "You see a(n) (Tile name)"
If no object and no tiles, 
show nothing
in the future, show items(between objects and tiles)
