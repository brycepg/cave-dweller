-- Todo --
|Unittest everything
|Use sqlite3 for serialization instead of shelve
|Queue/Event system for all entity actions
|Use mouse for movement
|mouse actions
|Add system for mutli-turn movements(Like diagnal movement)
|fix player block movement accross blocks(two move jump?)

|better input system
|abstract input system

|Game state machine
|Clickable menu
    - System for menus

|entity system
|better AI for monster movement(hand in hand with enitity component system)
|Centipides - Fish/rivers - Salamanders - Bats - Tree-like objects

|Make update flood hidden more efficient
    - hide enclosed areas at draw time

|move determining hidden blocks out of draw into initial generation to allow
|   reposition_objects or monster generation to avoid these hidden locations.
|Two-step process. 1. For generating hidden tiles(simple), 2. Updating edges relying on
|   ungenerated blocks(difficult)

|biomes - world generation algo tweaking - dynamic generation of build dig tiles?
|Advanced generation menu(tweak generator/ set seed)


| display log of messages 
| in-game log of accomplishments

| food - hunger/satiety - inventory - harvest - inventory menu
| babies(breeding)

help menu

| clusters of ore
| different types of rock

wound/combat system
'speed' affecting movement

-- consideration --
mutable tiles?

-- shelved --
map viewer/tuner program
"Update" a block from when it was previously loaded(take the difference of the block's saved turn and current turn, and run its process loop that number of times)
    - too slow / buggy (partial updates?)
    - 'general update' of block instead of object movement?

-- Done --
inactive, in memory blocks
priority for showing entities. tiles -> ground entityies(plants) -> monster -> player (last movement right now)
array for walkable tiles
array for hidden tiles
spaw x, y for map generation
| change all access to tiles array
use array for storing objects
debug menu
Using mouse for inspection
Hysteresis for loading/unload block to stop unsteady state
Don't update turns during setup process(separate turn update from process)
fix automatic movement from new game
allow objects to move out of map - temporarily load blocks to allow this(stagger cull blocks)
staggered update of nearby blocks(load, process, no draw) - may need to tweak still
add basic monster object
move off of root console(space of ui)
adding turns -> turn counter for moves at bottom of screen
using mouse/keyboard for inspection
